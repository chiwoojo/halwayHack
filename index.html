    Its a beautifully bloody afternoon and you've just got done chillin' on a battlefield of fallen souls. Being the bad ass knight that you are you decide its time to head over to a party you heard of in the town of TnA. The only problem is you the only route is through Walken Woods...where the evil, sinister Chis Topher Walken Monster lives and reings...but you heard this party has mad chicks AND you're a bad ass knight so you make the call and head on your way.
